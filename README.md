📊 Sales Data Analysis in Python

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes sales data to uncover trends, identify top-performing products, and visualize sales performance over time.
Using **Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib**, the analysis focuses on monthly sales, category breakdown, product performance, and sales trends using moving averages.

 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

* Python – Data analysis and scripting
* Pandas – Data cleaning & transformation
* Matplotlib – Data visualization
* Jupyter Notebook – Interactive analysis
